# Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security Tutorial
n the present world where cyber attackers are well equipped with state-of-the-art and sophisticated technologies, the risk for hacks and security braches is at its peak. For this particular reason, security protocols need to be in place. And what is better than countering hacking with hacking itself. This is where Ethical Hacking comes to play. This highly technical job is aimed to prevent security breaches, and being government approved, the pay is pretty high.

In this Ethical hacking & [Cyber security course](https://intellipaat.com/cyber-security-course-certification/) tutorial you will be able to get a clear idea on what is Ethical hacking, System hacking types, Footprinting, Ethical hacking enumeration, Network scanning, Threats from malware, Sniffing attacks, Social engineering attacks, Session hijacking, Hacking web servers and applications, SQL injection, Wireless network hacking, Mobile platform hacking, avoiding firewall and honeypot and various Encryption techniques.


## Why Cyber Security?
There was a huge data breach of 50 million Facebook accounts recently happened in March 2018 by a firm known as Cambridge Analytic a which harvested data for US Election Predictions. The data breach came to limelight and Facebook was levied a fine since they didn’t protect user details and due to their lack of transparency in the system. Imagine such a big firm like Facebook is susceptible to such data breach, so Cyber security is an important measure for every organization. Cyber security is used to avoid the data breaches, protect the integrity of networks and systems from attacks.
## History of Hacking & Cybersecurity
The first worm program was written in 1986 by a software programmer. The worm program was used to shut down the systems which are connected to the internet. Also in 1994, two groups were arrested for illegal access of 100 computers and bank accounts.
The history of Cyber security initially started as a research project, when a guy Bob Thomas designed a  “Creeper” to move between the terminals of ARPANET and a guy Ray Tomlinson replicated a similar program named “Reaper” (similar to antivirus software) to delete Creeper.

## Various threats on IT systems:
Any threat to the computer system might lead to data or information loss of the system. These threats can occur intentionally, accidentally or by any other means. There are different types of threats such as –

Security threat – Data stealing, exploitation of data, virus attack etc.
Physical threat – Loss or physical damage to the system
Internal – power supply, hardware fault etc.
External – lighting, natural disaster such as flood, earthquake
Human – theft, vandalism etc.
Non-physical threat – Loss of information, data corruption, cyber security breaches etc.
## Attacks on the IT system:
An Attack to the system can cause lot of harm such as data loss or monetary loss to the system. There are different types of attacks such as –

Virus – Piece of software to steal and damage computer
Spyware – Collects information against user’s own will
Phishing – Mostly done through email like fraudulent system
Worms – Self replicating from one system to another
Spam – Spam emails are computer security threat
Botnets – Bots used to target and attack systems
DOS attacks – Bombarding server with traffic to overwhelm the system
